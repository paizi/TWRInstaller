## Translating
Translation files located in [src/main/resources/com/khjxiaogu/tssap](https://github.com/TeamMoegMC/TWRInstaller/tree/master/src/main/resources/com/khjxiaogu/tssap), create a file named your locale code to add translation.

2. prepare configuration files in `tssap-configs` folder besides it, scheme:
```
{
  "channels": [
    {
      "name": "<name of the branch>",
      "id": "<unique id of the branch>",
      "url": "<meta file url>"
    }
  ],
  "selectedChannel": "<id of the default selected branch>",
  "selectedVersion": "<version within the selected branch, blank for automatic update>",
  "backupIncludes": [
    "<paths starts with to backup when overwritten>",
    "config/"
  ],
  "isClient": <boolean to indicate this is for client or dedicated server>
}
```
3. Add jvm argument: -javaagent=twr-installer.jar in your game launcher to run it and checks for update every single game launch.
## Protocol Scheme

}
```
### Version list
```
{
  "versions": [<array of version scheme>]
}
```
### Version scheme
```
{
  "versionName": "<name of the version>",
	"versionDate": "<publish utc date in yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss>",
	"packFilePath": "<full url path to modpack scheme>",
	"changelogPath": "<changelog full url path>"

```
### Modpack scheme

	"hash": "<SHA256 hash for file ignoring byte 09,0A,0D,20>",
	"link": "<Full download link for the file>",
	"size": <file size in byte to show correct progress when download>,
	"dist": "<client or server to mark the side for the file>",
	"compressed": <true if the file is deflated>
}
```
